Use Power BI interactive elements like slicers, bookmarks, and other filtering capabilities

An HR dashboard is a business intelligence tool that allows Human Resource teams to track, analyze and report on HR KPIs. Modern, interactive dashboards leverage an HR analytics platform which makes it easy to combine data from all systems and to explore this data directly within the dashboard deeply. This way, HR teams can quickly find insights that will improve recruiting, optimize workplace management and enhance employee performance.

The managers are performing in leading teams and providing support. A good manager-to-employee ratio ensures that managers can adequately support their teams. Overloading managers with too many direct reports may lead to burnout or ineffective supervision.

Despite having a large team, these top managers' teams did not participate in a special project, and their engagement survey score was approximately 3.8%.
